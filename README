INSTALL
--------
1) Binaries
Statically compiled binaries are available at the project website, for Linux
(i386) and Win32. Those should be suitable for most users.

2) Source
A Makefile is included; it compiles both under Linux and Windows (with MinGW).
DESTDIR is /usr by default (so the binary will be in /usr/bin/).
