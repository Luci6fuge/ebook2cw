<h1>ebook2cw - convert ebooks to morse MP3s</h1>
<p>Current version: 0.7.0 - June 3rd 2008 - See <a href="ebook2cw/ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> - <a href="ebook2cw/">Download directory</a></p>
<p>Windows <a href="#gui">GUI</a> version: 2008-07-13</p>

<hr>

<p><em>ebook2cw</em> is a command line program (optional GUI available) which converts a plain text
(ISO 8859-1 or UTF-8) ebook to morse code MP3 files. It works on several
platforms, including Windows and Linux.</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2> <p>A number of CW and MP3 parameters can be changed from
their default values, by command line switches or a config file (see below).  These are
(default values in brackets):</p>

<ul>
		<li><strong>-w wpm</strong> - CW speed in words per minute [25]</li>
		<li><strong>-e wpm</strong> -  [Optional] Effective CW speed. If set, the spaces are sent at this speed
       instead of the character speed set by -w ("Farnsworth").</li>
    		<li><strong>-W x</strong> -  [Optional] Extra Word spacing. Similar to -e, but only affects  the  inter-
       word spacing, not the inter-character spacing.</li>
		<li><strong>-f freq</strong> - audio frequency in Hz [600]</li>
		<li><strong>-Q minutes</strong> -  Increase  CW speed (QRQ) by 1wpm  in intervals of 'minutes'. Speed will be reset to the initial value at the start of each
       chapter. Zero means no QRQ. [0]</li>
   		<li><strong>-n </strong> - Disables resetting the speed when using
			the -Q option.</li>
		<li><strong>-p </strong> - Disables the paragraph separator
		(&lt;BT&gt;)</li>
		<li><strong>-R risetime</strong> - risetime of the CW signal, in samples [50]</li>
		<li><strong>-F falltime</strong> - falltime, samples [50]</li>
		<li><strong>-s samplerate</strong> - samplerate for the MP3 file
		[11025]</li>
		<li><strong>-b bitrate</strong> - MP3 bitrate, kbps [16]</li>
		<li><strong>-q quality</strong> - MP3 quality, 1 (best) to 9 (worst)
		[5]</li>
		<li><strong>-c chapter separator</strong> - Split chapters at this
		string [CHAPTER]</li>
		<li><strong>-o outfile-name</strong> - Output filename (chapter number
		and .mp3 will be appended) [Chapter]</li>
		<li><strong>-a author</strong> - Author for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3">ID3 tag</a>. Use quotes for strings with  spaces
       (e.g. "JW Goethe")</li>
       <li><strong>-t  title</strong>  -  Title for the ID3 tag. Use quotes for strings with spaces
       (e.g. "Faust II")</li>
       <li><strong>-k comment</strong> - Comment for the ID3  tag.  Use  quotes  for  strings  with
       spaces.</li>
       <li><strong>-y year</strong> - Year for the ID3 tag.</li>
       <li><strong>-u</strong> - Enables UTF-8 support (so far supported: Latin,
	   Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew and Arabic).</li>
<li><strong>-S</strong> [UTF|ISO] - Prints a table of the available <a href="#codes">character sets</a> and CW symbols in HTML format. 

</ul>

<h2>Text commands</h2>
<p>CW prosigns can be generated by enclosing arbitrary letters in angle brackets
(e.g. &lt;AR&gt;, &lt;SK&gt;, ...).</p>
<p>The tone frequency (f), speed  (w)  and  effective  speed  (e)  can  be
       changed  arbitrarily  within  the  text by inserting commands, starting
       with a pipe symbol, followed by the parameter to change and the  value.</p>

<p>Example:  <code>|f400</code>  changes  the tone frequency to 400Hz, <code>|w60</code> changes the
       speed to 60wpm.</p>


<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>ebook2cw has no graphical user interface itself, but a <a href="#gui">GUI interface is available as a separate program</a>.</p>
<p>These explanations aim at Windows users since
I asume that Linux users can adopt it more easily to their needs than the other way around.</p>
<p>To convert the ebook file "Book.txt", in which the chapters are
separated by "Chapter n" to MP3 files, called "Book-n.mp3", at 40wpm, the following
 commands have to be entered in the Windows command prompt (Start -&gt; Utilities -&gt; Command prompt):</p>

<div style="color:white;background-color:black;border:5px solid #000000;">
<pre><code>C:\test> ebook2cw.exe -w 40 -c Chapter -o Book- Book.txt
ebook2cw 0.6.2 - (c) 2008 by Fabian Kurz, DJ1YFK
Speed: 40 WpM, Freq: 600Hz, Chapter: >Chapter<, Encoding: ISO 8859-1

Initialized lame; samplerate=11025, bitrate=16, quality=5
Initializing CW buffers: dah_buf[991], dit_buf[329]

Starting Book-00.mp3
words: 10, minutes: 0
Finishing Book-00.mp3

Starting Book-01.mp3
words: 1312, minutes: 25
Finishing Book-01.mp3 

[...]

Total words: 4385, total time: 109 min
</code></pre></div>

<p>In this example everything takes place in <code>C:\test\</code>. It is assumed that ebook2cw.exe and the text file to convert are in this directory.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid using the command line, a 
<a href="ebook2cw/example/ebook2cw.bat">simple batch file</a> for Windows
is available. If placed in the same directory, you can comfortably drag &amp;
drop a text file to ebook2cw.</p>

<h2>Configuration File</h2>

<p>As of version 0.7.0 (July 2008), ebook2cw can read a configuration file,
<em>ebook2cw.conf</em>. In this file you can set all of the parameters which
are available as command line parameters, to reduce typing work each time you
use ebook2cw.<p>
<p>An <a href="ebook2cw/example/ebook2cw.conf">example ebook2cw.conf</a> with
further explanations is available.</p>

<tr><td>
	<h3 align="center">What is "ISO 8859-1" and "UTF-8"?</h3>

<p>ISO 8859-1 and UTF-8 are different enconding formats for texts. <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-1">ISO 8859-1</a>
is a standard encoding of the Latin alphabet (limited to 256 different symbols),
while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a> can encode all
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> characters,
which includes the Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic alphabets, and a lot more.</p> 
<p>If you are not sure about the encoding of your text: Most text in English
and European languages will likely by encoded as ISO 8859-1, text which
contains characters of different charsets will be UTF-8. If you try to convert
a text with the wrong encoding, ebook2cw may produce some warnings about
unknown characters.</p>

<h2><a id="codes" name="codes">Code tables</a></h2> 
<p>
As of version 0.6.0 (February 2008), ebook2cw supports the full ISO 8859-1 charset (where mappings to CW symbols are applicable) and
also UTF-8 (1- and 2-byte sequences). The latter so far includes most of the <strong>Latin</strong> characters, the <strong>Cyrillic</strong>,
<strong>Greek</strong>, <strong>Hebrew</strong> and <strong>Arabic</strong> alphabets.</p>
<p>The available codes can be printed by ebook2cw with the -S command line option (see above), here is the output: <a href="codes.html">UTF-8</a> - <a href="codes2.html">ISO 8859-1</a>. 
I am grateful for any feedback and additions to the tables.</p>
<p>As of version 0.7.0 (July 2008), arbitrary <em>character mappings</em> can
be defined. For example, you can automatically replace all accented characters 
or umlauts (e.g. &aacute; = .--.-, &auml; = .-.-) with more common characters
(like a = .-).</p>
<p>This is done by <em>map files</em> separately for ISO8859-1 and UTF-8 coded
texts. These map files must be specified in <em>ebook2cw.conf</em>, examples
are available for <a href="ebook2cw/example/isomap.txt">ISO8859-1</a> and 
<a href="ebook2cw/example/utf8map.txt">UTF-8</a>.</p>



<h2><a id="gui" name="gui">Graphical User Interface</a></h2>
<a href="ebook2cwgui.jpg"><img align="right" src="ebook2cwgui_t.jpg"></a>
<p>A simple graphical user interface for ebook2cw was was created with <a href="http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/">AutoIt</a>. It is a separate program
for Windows (runs under Wine on Linux) which needs to be in the same directory as ebook2cw.exe.</p>
<p>The program can be <a href="ebook2cw/ebook2cwgui.exe">downloaded here</a>. The interface is self explanatory, and it's possible to use
most functions of ebook2cw with it.</p>

<h2>Performance, Quality</h2>

<p>The default settings (except the speed) are probably suitable for most
people. A full hour of MP3 takes only 7MB, so depending on your speed, several
books will fit even on cheap 1GB portable mp3 players.</p>

<p>The speed of the conversion mainly depends on your CPU speed; for example
converting <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36">The War of the
		Worlds</a> to MP3 at 60 WpM, resulting in almost 17 hours of MP3 took
about 15 minutes on the author's 1.8GHz CPU.</p>


<h2>Where to get ebooks?</h2>
<p>Books are subject to different copyright laws in every country; there are
several online archives with free (copyright expired or public domain in the respective country) ebooks,
most notably:</p>

<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> (US)</li>
		<li><a href="http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/">Projekt Gutenberg</a> (DL,
		not related to the US Project Gutenberg)</li>
		<li><a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/">Project Gutenberg Australia</a></li>
</ul>

<p>User feedback indicates, that ebook2cw is also used to prepare morse courses lessons,
generate morse versions of DX-newsletters, etc.</p> 
<p>Here is a <a href="read-books.txt">list of books</a> that I already completed reading
in CW.</p>

<p>I claim no credit for the original idea to convert books to morse. 
Other hams (like <a href="http://www.schlaupelz.de/Alice_in_Wonderland.html">DL2KCD</a>,
<a href="http://www.k7qo.net/">K7QO</a>,
<a href="http://www.hotpeppersoftware.com/downloads/pom_downloads.html">AC4FS</a>,
<a href="http://69.51.152.43/morse/">KY8D</a>) have done
this before me, but I disliked the idea of distribution as audio files, which largely limits
flexibility and requires a lot of bandwidth. Instead, I decided to write a free piece of software
with which everyone can create a CW audio book to his or her own liking.</p>
