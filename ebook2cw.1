.SH SYNOPSIS

[OPTIONS] [INFILE]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ebook2cw
ebook2cw is a command line program which converts a plain text ebook to morse
code MP3 files. It works on several platforms, including Windows and Linux.

A number of CW and MP3 parameters can be changed from their default values, by
command line switches or a config file (see below). These are (default values in brackets):

.B -w wpm 
- CW speed in words per minute [25]

.B -e wpm 
- Effective CW speed. If set, the spaces are sent at this speed instead of the
character speed set by -w ("Farnsworth"). 

.B -W x
- Extra Word spacing. Similar to -e, but only affects the inter-word spacing,
not the inter-character spacing. 

.B -f freq 
- audio frequency in Hz [600]

.B -Q minutes
- Increase CW speed (QRQ) by 1 WpM in intervals of `minutes'. Speed will be 
reset to the initial value at the start of each chapter. [0]

.B -n
- Disables resetting the speed when using the -Q option.

.B -p
- Disables the paragraph separator (<BT>)

.B -R risetime 
- risetime, in samples [50]

.B -F falltime 
- falltime, samples [50]

.B -s samplerate 
- samplerate for the MP3 file [11025]

.B -b bitrate 
- MP3 bitrate, kbps [16]

.B -q quality 
- MP3 quality, 1 (best) to 9 (worst). CW still sounds very good with the worst quality, encoding time is greatly reduced. [5]

.B -c chapter separator 
- Split chapters at this string. [CHAPTER]

.B -o outfile-name 
- Output filename (chapter number and .mp3 will be appended) [Chapter]

.B -a author
- Author for the ID3 tag. Use quotes for strings with spaces (e.g. "JW Goethe")

.B -t title
- Title for the ID3 tag. Use quotes for strings with spaces (e.g. "Faust II")

.B -k comment
- Comment for the ID3 tag. Use quotes for strings with spaces.

.B -y year
- Year for the ID3 tag.

.B -u 
- Switches input encoding format to UTF-8. Currently supported alphabets
include Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic and Cyrillic. Default is ISO 8859-1.

.B -S [ISO|UTF]
- Shows a table of all available morse symbols for the ISO 8859-1 and UTF-8
character sets. Output in HTML format.

.SH TEXT COMMANDS
CW prosigns can be generated by enclosing arbitrary letters in angle brackets
(e.g. <AR>, <SK>, ...). 

The tone frequency (f), speed (w) and effective speed
(e) can be changed arbitrarily within the text by inserting commands, starting
with a pipe symbol, followed by the parameter to change and the value. 

Example: |f400 changes the tone frequency to 400Hz, |w60 changes the speed to
60wpm.

.SH CONFIG FILE AND CHARACTER MAPPINGS

ebook2cw looks for a config file, ebook2cw.conf, in which all settings that
can be changed by command line parameters can be set. Any settings made in the
config file can be overridden by command line arguments.

Additionally, two `map` files can be set in the config file, for ISO8859-1 and
UTF-8. You can map characters in those files to a string, which may be useful
to replace characters like the exclamation mark (!) to a period (.), which is
more common in CW.

A set of example config and map file and a description thereof can be found at
DESTDIR/share/doc/ebook2cw/examples/.
