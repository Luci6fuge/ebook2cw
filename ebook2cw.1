.B ebook2cw 
[OPTIONS]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ebook2cw
ebook2cw is a command line program which converts a plain text ebook to morse
code MP3 files. It works on several platforms, including Windows and Linux.

A number of CW and MP3 parameters can be changed from their default values, by
command line switches. These are (default values in brackets):

.B -w wpm 
- CW speed in words per minute [25]

.B -e wpm 
- Effective CW speed. If set, the spaces are sent at this speed instead of the
character speed set by -w ("Farnsworth"). 

.B -W x
- Extra Word spacing. Similar to -e, but only affects the inter-word spacing,
not the inter-character spacing. 

.B -f freq 
- audio frequency in Hz [600]

.B -Q minutes
- Increase CW speed (QRQ) by 1 WpM in intervals of `minutes'. Speed will be 
reset to the initial value at the start of each chapter. [0]

.B -n
- Disables resetting the speed when using the -Q option.

.B -R risetime 
- risetime, in samples [50]

.B -F falltime 
- falltime, samples [50]

.B -s samplerate 
- samplerate for the MP3 file [11025]

.B -b bitrate 
- MP3 bitrate, kbps [16]

.B -q quality 
- MP3 quality, 1 (best) to 9 (worst). CW still sounds very good with the worst quality, encoding time is greatly reduced. [5]

.B -c chapter separator 
- Split chapters at this string. [CHAPTER]

.B -o outfile-name 
- Output filename (chapter number and .mp3 will be appended) [Chapter]

.B -a author
- Author for the ID3 tag. Use quotes for strings with spaces (e.g. "JW Goethe")

.B -t title
- Title for the ID3 tag. Use quotes for strings with spaces (e.g. "Faust II")

.B -k comment
- Comment for the ID3 tag. Use quotes for strings with spaces.

.B -y year
- Year for the ID3 tag.

.B -u 
- Switches input encoding format to UTF-8. Currently supported alphabets
include Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic and Cyrillic. Default is ISO 8859-1.

.B -S [ISO|UTF]
- Shows a table of all available morse symbols for the ISO 8859-1 and UTF-8
character sets. Output in HTML format.

CW prosigns can be generated by enclosing arbitrary letters in angle brackets
(e.g. <AR>, <SK>, ...). 

The tone frequency (f), speed (w) and effective speed
(e) can be changed arbitrarily within the text by inserting commands, starting
with a pipe symbol, followed by the parameter to change and the value. 

Example: |f400 changes the tone frequency to 400Hz, |w60 changes the speed to
60wpm.
